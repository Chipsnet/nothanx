# NothanX

> Why does x.com not provide embeddingðŸ¤®

NothanX is a Chrome extension that automatically replaces links to vxtwitter.com and other sites when you press the "Copy Link" button on Twitter.

## Motivation

For some reason, Twitter embedding has been unstable since Twitter was acquired.      
Have you ever had the sad experience of pasting it into Discord or other sites, only to have it not show up on the card?

With this tool, you can use vxtwitter.com, fixupx.com, etc. to get a nice Twitter embedding feature.
